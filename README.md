# Overview

ASER -- short for "Advanced Software Engineering Recommender" -- is a collaborative project for the Advanced Software Engineering course of the University of Zurich in Spring 2018 of Dominik BÃ¼nzli and Selin Fabel. The recommender has been modeled after [Calcite](http://edelstein.pebbles.cs.cmu.edu/calcite/), a work of Mooty et al. (2010)  et al. It consists of two parts:
- the parser (where the source code is stored [here](https://github.com/sflin/ASER_Parser))
- the recommender (the source code of this repository)

# Installation
ASER is built with Travis-ci. Its version are deployed to a packagecloud-repository. To re-use the ASER-Recommender, developers can simply add the following code-snippet to the dependencyManagment section of the pom.xml:

<dependency>
  <groupId>ASER_Recommender</groupId>
  <artifactId>ASER_Recommender</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>

For re-usage of the ASER-Parser, the following dependencies are required:
<dependency>
  <groupId>ASER_Paser</groupId>
  <artifactId>ASER_Parser</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>


# Execution
For execution, ASER needs a set of so-called class-collections which can be obtained by running the ASER-parser over one of the publicly availalbe context-data-sets provided by the [KaVe-project](http://www.kave.cc/datasets). Additionally, ASER requires a set of annotated User-event data. In our implementation, we built the class-collections with the data-set [Contexts (May 3, 2017)](http://www.st.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/artifacts/kave/Contexts-170503.zip), the recommender was tested with the interaction data [Events (Jan 18, 2018)](http://www.st.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/artifacts/kave/Events-170301-2.zip). For demonstration purpose, a subset of the used sets is included.
In order to run the parser, the context-files to parse must be placed in a zipped folder. The application can then be started by passing the absolute path of the zipped folder as a command line argument and as a second argument the absolute path of where to store the parsed files. These arguments can also be ommitted, but then the context-files must be placed in /home/user/Contexts or C:\Users\<Name>\Contexts respectively. The class-collections are written to a folder called "archive" on the user's home directory.

# Evaluation:

If the ASER-recommender is started by passing the flag "-e" as an argument, in addition to a ranked list of recommendations, it will also show how well the recommender performed, , i.e. measurements for precision, recall, number of successful and unsuccessful recommendations and the average rank (in case of success) will be shown. Precision is calculated by TruePositive / (TruePositive + FalsePositive). In this context, TruePositive refers to the amount of queries where the actual selection was successfully found in the recommended hit-list. FalsePositive stands for the amount of queries where a hit-list exists but the actual selection is not part of it. Recall is calculated by TruePositive / (FalseNegative + TruePositive) where FalseNegative denotes the amount of queries where no hit-list exists at all. The average rank corresponds to the number of hits which have to be examined on average until a hit is found.
